      <p>Its been a while since I last wrote a post here, the majority on this site were migrated from an older hugo generated template, which will explain the timestamps on the posts.</p>
<p>I have been busy in my career pivoting away from what we typically think of pentesting (testing broad external/internal networks for known vulnerabilities, running nessus and validating, etc) and towards where my interest currently lies: vulnerability research and binary exploitation.</p>
<p>Since writing my posts about the Phoenix ARM challenges, I have had hands-on experience fuzzing real world targets and disclosing vulnerabilities to the developers. This has been mostly between pentest clients, and was on an internal project at my employer. However, I have recently discovered the world of desktop application testing vectors in FedRamp and commercial penetration testing. I managed to get myself into two of these testing vectors recently and I found them to be a good way to begin my professional vulnerability research journey.</p>
<p>During my most recent of these engagements, I was tasked with seeing what I could find in a Linux AV product that I am not at liberty to expose the name of. At the end of my time (I had about a week and a few days, going from zero knowledge of where to start), I had zero vulnerabilities to disclose. While I later found an interesting way to bypass registering the product on Windows, I focused almost exclusively on the Linux client.</p>
<p>This Linux AV included four seperate installations: the open driver, the proprietary driver, the AV service, and the UI. I know, this should have all been in one package. As I stated before, I had zero knowledge of where to start as the lead on the project who has been doing this for years was sick the majority of the time I had time on this project. After figuring out the installation I was left with a bit of a mystery to solve. There were .dll files included in the install directory. I wasted quite some time looking at these wondering how a Linux client can call exported functions from a Windows DLL file. As it turns out these files did not export any functions. I wish I knew why they were included, but maybe I will learn that another day.</p>
<p>Eventually I turned my attention to the Shared Object (.so) files. Using IDA Free (our IDA Pro license was registered elsewhere), I took a peek into the .so file and started to piece together what I was really looking at. For the sake of this example, I will use something I had noticed before. While running strace and restarting the AV service, I saw an attempt to run execve on /usr/bin/sestatus which is a binary to tell the AV whether SE Linux was installed or not. Using IDA Free I found the function within one of the .so files which executed this command:</p>
<p><img src="/images/ida_helper.png" alt="img"></p>
<p>Since this is my first time reversing a shared object file, I wanted to figure out how you could call one of these functions in a test file as this seemed a way one could create a test harness to fuzz these functions. Who knows, if the parsing functions can be called this way, you could find a bug in the function! I did this in two ways, both of which work well. The first way I accomplished this was via the <code>dlopen</code> function in C. This allowed me to dynamically load the library function, cast it as a void pointer, and execute this function.</p>
<p><img src="/images/dylopen_code.png" alt="img"></p>
<p><img src="/images/dylopen_compile.png" alt="img"></p>
<p><img src="/images/dylopen_run.png" alt="img"></p>
<p>One advantage this solution has is the ability to specify the shared object file and not worry about dynamic linking via the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable. The downside is, well honestly I am unsure of any real downsides besides performance. In a fuzzing environment this may be the real killer to use the second method which is, as you could guess, dynamically linking at compile time.</p>
<p><img src="/images/linking_code.png" alt="img"></p>
<p><img src="/images/linking_compile.png" alt="img"></p>
<p><img src="/images/linking_run.png" alt="img"></p>
<p>Only my future endeavers will tell which is the best use case. I&rsquo;l hedge my bets on the second. During my time looking through these .so files, I noticed many functions sent error messages to syslog. An easy way to constantly monitor the syslog messages for any process you are playing with (in my case I did not realize I needed to be root until after I checked out /dev/log/syslog):</p>
<p><code>tail -f /var/log/syslog | grep binaryname</code></p>
<p>Thats all for now.</p>
